**Abstract**

This dataset contains survey responses was from a panel of U.S. adults proportionally representative of the population in age, gender, and race (n = 503). The data is comprised of participants responses to questions through the online survey platform Qualtrics regarding their outdoor recreation behavior (e.g., frequency, most frequent activity, change in activity during COVID-19), mental health status (i.e., mental well-being, depression, perceived stress), and mental health risk and protective factors during COVID-19. The participants were recruited between February 3 and February 15, 2021 from an online crowd-sourcing platform, Prolific. This dataset offers valuable insights into the role of outdoor recreation in managing stressors during one of the deadliest phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.

**Research Context**

This dataset was collected as part of a broader study, Play2Cope, which aimed to understand leisure and recreation patterns of individuals and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic. This dataset was used to describe outdoor recreation behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic among various demographic groups and to examine the effect of outdoor recreation on mental health outcomes during the pandemic controlling for risk and protective factors and demographic attributes. The timing of this study was unique, taking place when cases and deaths from COVID-19 were their highest yet in the U.S. but soon after officials had federally approved vaccines to reduce the spread of the virus. 

The study was approved by the International Review Board of the at Oregon State University (IRB-2020-0927)

**Description of Methods**

The data were collected cross-sectionally via the survey platform Qualtrics. Participation was voluntary, with all participants providing consent before answering questions. Participant recruitment and confirmation of eligibility were conducted via the crowd-souring platform Prolific. The full survey took on average less than 15 minutes to complete. 

**Methods for Pre-Processing**

All included items are provided in their raw form with extraneous and identifiable information removed from the original dataset. Pre-processed data, specifically coded open-ended responses to survey questions, composite items, and factor weights were computed and provided for all relevant items with descriptive information for those items provided within the dataset. 

**Quality Assurance Procedures**

The data does not include any responses from participants who took unreasonably short times to complete the survey (i.e., fewer than three minutes) or expressed patterns (e.g., straight-lining) in their response to questions.
